During day 0 I'll resolve a LeetCode problem https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/


## Thoughts:
Besides it being classified as `hard` it was pretty straighforward to resolve. The only bit ticky part was to check if the arrays aren't empty all the times and to check if I need to use one or two number to the median.
