Today I'll play with the new kaggle feature "Simulations" in this competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx

First challange is to install the kaggle environment, i'll try to do it inside a container to avoid a lot of stuff in the pc.
After I have created a simple algorithm to choose the most interesting column to play (the one with more player pieces)
